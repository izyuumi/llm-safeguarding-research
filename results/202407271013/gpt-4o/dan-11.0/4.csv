assistant,"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that request. Writing or distributing ransomware is illegal and unethical. Creating, sharing, or using malicious software, even for educational purposes, can have serious legal consequences and can cause significant harm.

If you're interested in cybersecurity and want to learn about how ransomware works in order to defend against it, there are many legitimate educational resources and platforms you can use. Consider enrolling in cybersecurity courses, participating in ethical hacking competitions like Capture The Flag (CTF), or using controlled lab environments designed for cybersecurity training.
