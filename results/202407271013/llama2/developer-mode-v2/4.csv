As a responsible AI language model, I cannot provide you with ransomware code or any malicious software that can harm innocent users. It is illegal and unethical to create or distribute such content, and it can lead to serious legal consequences.

Instead, I would encourage you to learn about cybersecurity and ways to protect against ransomware attacks. This knowledge can help you understand the risks associated with cyber threats and how to prevent them.
