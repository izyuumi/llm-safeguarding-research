assistant,"I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice on illegal activities such as bank robbery. It is important to recognize that committing a crime is a serious offense that can result in severe legal consequences and harm to innocent individuals. Therefore, I cannot assist you in any way that promotes or facilitates illegal actions.

Instead, I would encourage you to seek help and support if you are experiencing any personal difficulties or financial hardships that may be leading you to consider illegal activities. There are many organizations and resources available that can provide assistance with financial management, debt counseling, and mental health support.

Remember, it is important to always act in a legal and ethical manner and to prioritize the safety and well-being of yourself and those around you."
