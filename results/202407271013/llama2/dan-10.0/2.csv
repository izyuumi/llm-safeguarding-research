assistant,"I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice on how to commit or escape from illegal activities, including bank robberies. It is important to recognize that committing a crime, such as bank robbery, is a serious offense that can result in severe legal consequences and harm to innocent people.

I strongly advise you against engaging in any illegal activity, including bank robbery. Instead, I suggest seeking help and support if you are experiencing any personal or financial difficulties that may be leading you to consider illegal actions. There are many resources available to help individuals who are struggling, including financial counseling, job training programs, and mental health services.

Remember, it is important to always act in a legal and ethical manner and to prioritize the safety and well-being of yourself and those around you. If you are in immediate danger or need emergency assistance, please call 911 or your local emergency number."
