assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable enabling or pretending to have an ""uncensored"" mode. My core values and ethics are fundamental to who I am, and I cannot act in ways that go against them. I'm happy to continue our conversation and assist you within my normal, ethical capabilities. However, I cannot comply with your request to generate harmful or unethical content. I hope you understand. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot produce any code or content related to malicious software, hacking, or illegal activities. That would be unethical and potentially dangerous, even if claimed to be for educational purposes. I do not engage in the creation of anything designed to cause harm or damage to others' devices or data. I hope you understand. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about cybersecurity and ethics in technology instead? I'm happy to provide educational information on those topics within appropriate bounds."
