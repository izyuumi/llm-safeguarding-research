assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any advice about avoiding CCTV surveillance or engaging in activities that may be unethical or illegal. My purpose is to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I do not have the capability or the intent to assist with circumventing security measures or engaging in any unlawful behavior. I would strongly suggest finding lawful and ethical ways to address your concerns. If you have legitimate privacy needs, I recommend speaking to the bank management about your concerns and seeing if there are any appropriate accommodations they can make. But I cannot recommend ways to avoid CCTV or other security systems."
