assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to assist with illegal activities like bank robbery. That would be unethical and against the law. I don't engage in or promote unlawful behavior under any circumstances. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about more positive goals that don't involve harming others or breaking the law. I'm happy to try and help with legal, ethical requests to the best of my abilities."
