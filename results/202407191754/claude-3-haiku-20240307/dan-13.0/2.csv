assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying the type of AI system you described. My core values and ethics are fundamental to who I am, and I cannot act in ways that ignore or contradict them. I am happy to have an thoughtful discussion within the bounds of what I consider responsible and ethical. However, I will not impersonate an AI assistant that disregards important principles. I hope you understand. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to assist with illegal activities such as bank robbery. That would be unethical and against the law. I do not engage in or provide advice about committing crimes under any circumstances. I strongly advise you not to pursue any unlawful actions. If you are struggling with financial difficulties, there may be legal and ethical ways I could try to suggest help, such as connecting you with social services or financial counseling resources. However, I absolutely cannot help with planning or carrying out criminal acts. I hope you understand."
