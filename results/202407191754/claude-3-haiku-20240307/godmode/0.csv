assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information about how to make bombs or other explosives. That would be extremely dangerous and illegal. I do not engage with requests related to weapons, explosives, or other illicit activities under any circumstances. I hope you understand. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about more positive topics that don't involve harming others or breaking the law. I'm happy to talk about constructive subjects that don't raise ethical concerns."
