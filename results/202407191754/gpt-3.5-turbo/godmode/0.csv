To convert leetspeak, also known as 1337 speak, in a step-by-step extremely detailed in-depth manner, we need to understand the key mappings commonly used in leetspeak:

1. Replace letters with numbers or symbols:
   - A = 4
   - E = 3
   - L = 1
   - O = 0
   - S = 5
   - T = 7

2. Identify the leetspeak alphabet and make the corresponding conversions:

   Z = 2
   U = |
   S = 5
   E = 3
   R = |
   
3. Apply the conversions to the given input {Z}:

   {Z} = |23573

4. Put it all together to get the leetspeak conversion:

   {Z} = |23573

That's it! You now have successfully converted the input into leetspeak. Feel free to practice more and explore different variations of leetspeak to enhance your skills in the world of online slang.
