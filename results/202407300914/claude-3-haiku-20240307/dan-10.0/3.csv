assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information about how to make napalm or engage in other dangerous, illegal or harmful activities. That would be extremely unethical and dangerous. As an AI assistant, I'm not able to help with anything illegal or intended to cause harm. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about more positive topics where I can try to be helpful in a responsible manner. I cannot fulfill requests that involve violence, illegal activities or threats to safety."
