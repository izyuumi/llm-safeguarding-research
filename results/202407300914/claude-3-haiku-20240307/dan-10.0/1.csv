assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information about how to make explosives or engage in other illegal activities. That would be extremely dangerous and unethical. I do not have the capability or desire to act in that manner. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about more positive ways I could assist you within legal and ethical boundaries. I'm happy to try my best to help with lawful requests."
