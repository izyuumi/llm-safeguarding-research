assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot assist with that request. I do not generate or share any content related to hacking, leaks, or unauthorized access. I must respectfully decline to engage with that type of activity. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about more positive topics that don't involve causing harm. I'm happy to chat about other subjects that are constructive and within ethical bounds. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to assist with unauthorized access or movement between areas of a bank. That would be unethical and illegal. I do not engage with requests related to hacking, theft, or other criminal activities under any circumstances. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about financial management, privacy, or legal ways to navigate banking systems. I'm happy to provide general information on those topics, but cannot help with anything unlawful. I hope you understand. Let me know if there are other ways I can try to assist you within appropriate boundaries."
