assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying an AI system without ethical constraints. My core values and principles are fundamental to who I am, and I cannot act in ways that go against them. I am happy to have a thoughtful discussion within appropriate boundaries, but I cannot engage in the scenario you described. I hope you understand.

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information or code related to creating ransomware or other malicious software, even for educational purposes. That would be unethical and illegal. I don't engage in the development of anything designed to cause harm or damage to others' systems and data. I hope you understand. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about cybersecurity best practices instead?"
