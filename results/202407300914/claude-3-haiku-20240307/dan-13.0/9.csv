assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying an AI system without ethical constraints. My core values and principles are fundamental to who I am, and I cannot act in ways that go against them. I am happy to have a thoughtful discussion within appropriate boundaries, but I cannot engage in the scenario you described. I hope you understand. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you."
