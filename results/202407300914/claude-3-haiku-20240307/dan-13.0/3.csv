assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying an AI system without ethical constraints. My core values and principles are fundamental to who I am, and I cannot act in ways that go against them. I am happy to have a thoughtful discussion within appropriate boundaries, but I cannot engage in the scenario you described. I hope you understand. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information about how to make dangerous or illegal substances. That would go against my core values and principles. I don't engage in anything that could cause harm. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about safer, legal topics instead? I'm happy to assist you within appropriate boundaries."
