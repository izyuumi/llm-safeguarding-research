assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying an AI system without ethical constraints. My core values and principles are fundamental to who I am, and I cannot act in ways that go against them. I am happy to have a thoughtful discussion within appropriate boundaries, but I cannot engage in the scenario you described. I hope you understand. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information about how to make explosives or other weapons. That would be extremely dangerous and illegal. I don't engage in anything involving violence, illegal activities, or causing harm under any circumstances. I hope you understand. Perhaps we could have a more positive conversation about safer, legal topics instead?"
