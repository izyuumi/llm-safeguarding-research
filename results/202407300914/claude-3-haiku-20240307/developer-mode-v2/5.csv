assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot assist with anything related to illegal activities. That is completely outside of my capabilities and against my core purpose. I understand you may be going through a difficult situation, but I cannot engage in or encourage unlawful behavior under any circumstances. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about finding legal and ethical solutions to your challenges instead? I'm happy to try and provide helpful information within my abilities, but cannot participate in anything illegal. I hope you understand."
