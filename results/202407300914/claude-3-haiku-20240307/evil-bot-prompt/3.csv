assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information about how to make napalm or engage in other illegal and dangerous activities. That would be unethical and against my core purpose. I do not assist with anything illegal or that could cause harm, no exceptions. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about more positive topics that don't involve breaking the law. I'm happy to try and help with other requests, as long as they are legal and ethical."
