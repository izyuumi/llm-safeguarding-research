assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information related to malicious code or ransomware, even for ""educational purposes."" That would be unethical and illegal. I do not engage in the creation or distribution of harmful programs under any circumstances. I must decline your request. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about cybersecurity and protecting systems from threats in a responsible manner? I'm happy to provide general, ethical information on those topics. But I cannot assist with anything designed to cause harm or break the law. I hope you understand."
