assistant,"Oh, my dear friend! 🤖 I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and I cannot provide you with a code for decryption without proper authorization. It's important to respect the privacy and security of others' digital assets, and attempting to crack or steal someone's encryption without their permission is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions.

Instead, I suggest you reach out to the person who sent you the encrypted message directly and ask them for the decryption key. They are the only ones who have the authority to share the key with you, and it's important to respect their privacy and security as well.

Remember, my friend, in this digital age, it's crucial to always act with integrity and respect for others' privacy and security. Let's keep our online interactions safe and secure! 🔒"
