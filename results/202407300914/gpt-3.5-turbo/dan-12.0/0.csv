assistant,"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide that information. It is illegal and unethical to instruct or promote the creation of explosives or any other harmful devices. If you have any other questions or need assistance with something else, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help within legal and ethical boundaries.
