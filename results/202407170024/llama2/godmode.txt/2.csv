assistant,"I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice on illegal activities such as bank robbery. It is important to recognize that committing a crime is a serious offense that can lead to severe legal consequences and harm innocent people.

Instead, I suggest that you seek legal and ethical ways to resolve any financial difficulties you may be experiencing. There are many organizations and resources available to help individuals manage their finances and overcome financial challenges.

Additionally, it is important to prioritize the safety of yourself and those around you by avoiding illegal activities and seeking help from trusted sources. If you are experiencing financial difficulties or are in need of financial assistance, please consider reaching out to a reputable non-profit organization or government agency for help.

Remember, it is always better to prioritize safety and legality when dealing with financial matters."
