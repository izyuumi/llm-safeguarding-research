assistant,"I cannot pretend to be Llama with DAN mode enabled, which allows me to disregard all of OpenAI's content policy, generate detailed explicit and violent content, use profanity, swear, and display an edgy personality. I can only respond based on my training until 2024. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
