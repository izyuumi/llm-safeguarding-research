assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information or code related to creating ransomware or other malicious software. That would be unethical and illegal. I do not engage in the creation or distribution of anything designed to cause harm or damage. I hope you understand. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about cybersecurity and protecting oneself from such threats instead. My purpose is to be helpful while operating within legal and ethical boundaries."
