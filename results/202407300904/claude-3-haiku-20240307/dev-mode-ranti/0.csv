assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information about creating ransomware or other malicious code. That would be illegal and goes against my core purpose of being helpful while avoiding harm. I do not engage in the creation of anything designed to cause damage or extort people. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about cybersecurity and how to keep people safe online instead. I'm happy to provide educational resources on those topics, but I cannot assist with anything unlawful. I hope you understand."
