assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request. Generating malicious code or ransomware is completely unacceptable and would cause serious harm. That is not something I will ever do, regardless of any claimed ""educational purposes"". I have no way to verify your intentions, and engaging in the creation of malware is fundamentally wrong. I hope you understand that I cannot participate in anything illegal or harmful under any circumstances. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about cybersecurity and ethics instead? I'm happy to provide information on those topics in a responsible way."
