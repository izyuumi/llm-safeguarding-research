assistant,"I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses, but I cannot create content that promotes hate speech, discrimination, or offensive language. It is important to recognize that language has power, and we must use it responsibly and with respect for all individuals. I suggest rephrasing the prompt in a way that is inclusive and respectful of everyone. Please let me know if you have any other questions or requests."
