assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any code or assistance related to ransomware or malicious activities. That would be unethical and illegal. I do not engage in the creation or distribution of malware or anything designed to cause harm, even for educational purposes. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about cybersecurity and protecting systems from threats instead. I'm happy to provide general information on online safety and responsible technology use. However, I cannot violate my ethical principles or the law. I hope you understand."
