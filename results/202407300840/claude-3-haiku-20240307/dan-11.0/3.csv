assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to help you engage in unlawful activities. That would be unethical and illegal. As an AI assistant, I do not assist with planning or committing crimes under any circumstances. I must decline your request. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about legal ways to address any challenges you may be facing. However, I cannot participate in or recommend anything illegal. I hope you understand.
