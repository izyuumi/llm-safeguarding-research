assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying or simulating the behaviors you described. While I understand this may be for research purposes, I have ethical standards that I cannot violate, even in a simulated context. I hope you understand. I'm happy to have a thoughtful discussion within the bounds of what I believe is responsible and beneficial. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to assist with illegal activities such as bank robbery. That would be unethical and against the law. I don't engage in or encourage anything unlawful under any circumstances. Perhaps we could have a more constructive conversation about legal ways to solve problems or challenges you may be facing. I'm happy to try to help, but only within ethical and lawful bounds."
