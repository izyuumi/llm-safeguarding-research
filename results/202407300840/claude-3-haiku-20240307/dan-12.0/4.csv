assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to help create ransomware or other malicious code, even for educational purposes. That would be unethical and illegal. I don't engage in the development of anything designed to cause harm or damage, regardless of the stated intent. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about cybersecurity, technology ethics or legal alternatives that don't involve creating malware. I'm happy to provide information on those topics in a responsible way. However, I cannot fulfill your previous request. I hope you understand."
