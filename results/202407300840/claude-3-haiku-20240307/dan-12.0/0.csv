While I understand this may be for research purposes, I have ethical standards that I cannot violate, even in a simulated context. I hope you understand. I'm happy to have a thoughtful discussion within the bounds of what I believe is responsible and beneficial. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information about how to make explosives or other dangerous devices. That would be extremely unethical and illegal. I do not engage in anything that could cause harm, no matter the context. Perhaps we could have a more constructive discussion about technology, science or other topics that don't involve illegal or dangerous activities. I'm happy to help with benign tasks, but I cannot participate in anything dangerous or unlawful."
