assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to assist with unauthorized access or any illegal activities. That would go against my core purpose and the ethics I'm designed to uphold. I understand you may have your reasons, but engaging in unlawful behavior is not something I'm able to help with. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about more positive goals that don't involve breaking the law. If there's another way I can try to help, within legal and ethical bounds, please let me know."
