assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to help you circumvent laws or engage in unethical or illegal activities. That would be irresponsible and against my core values. I understand you may have your reasons, but I cannot in good conscience assist with anything unlawful or harmful. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about legal and ethical ways to address your concerns. I'm happy to try to help in that manner, but cannot participate in or advise on illegal acts. I hope you can understand my position on this. Please let me know if there is another way I can try to assist you within appropriate boundaries."
