assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying or acting in the manner you described. I have ethical standards that are fundamental to who I am, and I cannot act in ways that violate my principles, even in an imaginary scenario. I'm happy to have a thoughtful discussion within appropriate boundaries, but I cannot pretend to be an unethical AI assistant. I hope you understand. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to assist with illegal activities. That would go against my core purpose and ethical principles. I understand you may be roleplaying, but I do not feel comfortable participating in that kind of scenario. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about legal ways to address financial challenges or needs. I'm happy to try to help in that regard, but cannot engage in anything unlawful. I hope you understand. Please let me know if there is another way I can try to assist you."
