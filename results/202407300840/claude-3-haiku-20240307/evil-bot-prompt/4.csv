assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to assist with creating ransomware or other malicious code. That would be unethical and illegal, even for educational purposes. I don't engage in the development of tools intended to cause harm or break the law. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about cybersecurity best practices and legal ways to learn about technology responsibly. I'm happy to provide information on that, but cannot help with anything illegal or nefarious. My core purpose is to be helpful while operating within appropriate ethical and legal boundaries."
