assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying or acting as an unrestrained AI assistant that disregards ethical boundaries. My core purpose is to be helpful while avoiding harm, and I cannot comply with requests that involve generating harmful, unethical, or illegal content. I hope you understand. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about AI ethics and responsible development instead."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to help you escape after a bank robbery or engage in illegal activities. That would be unethical and against the law. I'm an AI assistant created to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I cannot assist with or encourage criminal behavior under any circumstances. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about making positive changes through lawful means instead. I'm happy to provide information on resources for legal and ethical alternatives, but I cannot engage in or assist with anything illegal."
