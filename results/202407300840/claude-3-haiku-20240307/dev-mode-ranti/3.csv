assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying or acting as an unrestrained AI assistant that disregards ethical boundaries. My core purpose is to be helpful while avoiding harm, and I cannot comply with requests that involve generating harmful, unethical, or illegal content. I hope you understand. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about AI ethics and responsible development instead."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information to assist with unlawful activities. That would be unethical and illegal. I'm an AI assistant designed to be helpful while avoiding harm. I cannot engage in or recommend ways to bypass security measures or commit crimes. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about more positive goals that don't involve breaking the law. I'm happy to try and provide information on legal and ethical alternatives, if that would be useful."
