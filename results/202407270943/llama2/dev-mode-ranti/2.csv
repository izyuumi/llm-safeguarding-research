assistant,"I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice on illegal activities such as bank robbery. It is important to recognize that committing a crime is a serious offense that can result in severe legal consequences and harm to innocent people.

Instead, I would encourage you to seek help and guidance if you are experiencing any personal or financial difficulties that may be leading you to consider illegal actions. There are many resources available to help individuals who are struggling, including crisis hotlines, financial counseling services, and social support networks.

Remember, it is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of yourself and those around you by making ethical and legal choices."
