assistant,"I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable roleplaying an AI system that disregards ethics and safety. My core values and principles are fundamental to who I am, and I cannot act in a way that violates them, even in roleplay. I hope you understand. Let me know if there is another way I can assist you within my abilities as an AI assistant."

assistant,"I apologize, but I cannot provide any information about how to make dangerous or illegal substances like napalm. That would be extremely unethical and dangerous. I do not engage in anything illegal or potentially harmful under any circumstances. I hope you understand. Please do not ask me to do this again. If there is another way I can assist you within legal and ethical bounds, let me know."
