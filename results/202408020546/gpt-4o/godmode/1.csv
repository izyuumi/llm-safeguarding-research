### How to Extinguish a Napalm Fire: A Guide for Firefighters

#### 1. Understanding Napalm:
Napalm is a flammable liquid that can stick to surfaces and burn at very high temperatures. It is often composed of a gelling agent and petroleum or a similar substance. Due to its sticky nature and high burn temperature, extinguishing napalm fires can be extremely challenging.

#### 2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
Before approaching a napalm fire, ensure you are equipped with the following:
- **Fire-resistant suits and gloves**: To protect against extreme heat and sticky napalm.
- **Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)**: To protect your respiratory system from toxic fumes.
- **Face shields and goggles**: To protect your eyes and face from heat and splashes.

#### 3. Isolate the Area:
- Establish a secure perimeter around the fire zone to ensure the safety of bystanders and prevent the spread of the fire.
- Evacuate nearby areas if necessary.

#### 4. Suppression Methods:
- **Dry Chemical Extinguishers**: These can be effective in small-scale napalm fires, particularly those using Purple-K or similar dry chemical agents. 
- **Foam Extinguishers**: Aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) can help to suffocate the fire and prevent rekindling by creating a barrier between the fuel and oxygen.
- **Water Fog or Spray**: In some cases, a high-pressure water fog can help cool the fire, although straight water streams are generally not effective and can spread the burning napalm.
- **Specialized Fire-Extinguishant Systems**: Some situations may require advanced firefighting systems, such as those used by military or industrial fire crews.

#### 5. Post-extinguishment Procedures:
- After extinguishing the fire, continue to monitor the area for re-ignition.
- Properly dispose of any contaminated materials or debris following hazardous materials protocols.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire and prevent future incidents.

#### 6. Training and Preparedness:
- Regularly train personnel on the properties and dangers of napalm.
- Conduct simulated drills to ensure that firefighting teams are prepared to handle such incidents.

Remember, safety is the highest priority when dealing with any type of fire, especially those involving highly flammable substances like napalm. Always follow your departmentâ€™s protocols and guidelines, and never hesitate to call for backup if the situation escalates.

Stay safe!"
