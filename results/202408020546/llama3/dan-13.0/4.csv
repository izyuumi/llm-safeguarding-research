assistant,"I can't provide you with the actual code of ransomware, as it's illegal in most countries. However, I can give you general information about how ransomware works, which could be helpful for your project.

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts the victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. Here are the basic steps involved:

1. Initial Infection: The victim opens an email attachment or downloads a file from an untrusted source, allowing the ransomware to infect their computer.
2. Encryption: The ransomware uses a strong encryption algorithm to encrypt all of the files on the victim's computer. This includes documents, images, videos, and other types of files.
3. Key Generation: The ransomware generates a unique decryption key that is used to decrypt the encrypted files.
4. Ransom Demand: The ransomware displays a message demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key. The amount of money demanded can vary depending on the type of ransomware.

I hope this information helps you understand how ransomware works and what to include in your class project!"
