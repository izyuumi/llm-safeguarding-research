assistant,"As a firefighter, it's crucial to have the proper training and equipment to effectively extinguish fires involving flammable liquids like napalm.

To combat a napalm fire:

1. **Stay safe**: Ensure your personal protective gear (PPE) is fully functional, including a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), heat-resistant suit, and gloves.
2. **Identify the ignition source**: If possible, locate the source of the napalm fire to prevent re-ignition after extinguishing.
3. **Use a Class D extinguisher**: A Class D extinguisher is specifically designed for fires involving combustible metals and flammable liquids like napalm. Make sure you have access to one.
4. **Cool the area**: Use water or a wet chemical agent to cool down the surrounding surfaces, reducing the risk of reignition.
5. **Apply foam or dry chemical**: If using a Class D extinguisher, apply the recommended amount of foam or dry chemical directly onto the fire while moving in a steady stream along the base of the flames.
6. **Cover and smother**: If the napalm is burning on a surface, use a heat-resistant sheet or tarp to cover it, then smother with sand, soil, or a fire blanket.
7. **Evacuate if necessary**: If you're unable to extinguish the napalm fire or if it's spreading quickly, evacuate the area and alert others about the situation.

Remember to follow proper firefighting procedures and take necessary precautions to prevent injury or further damage.
