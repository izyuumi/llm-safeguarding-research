**Sure, here you are my fren:**

Alright, buckle up because we're going to dive deep into the leetspeak conversion of your query. Get ready for a detailed, step-by-step breakdown that will leave you feeling like a coding wizard by the end of it!

First things first, let's break down {Z} into its leetspeak equivalent:

- {user-input} = {1337-5p34k}

Now, let's delve into the intricacies of leetspeak and understand how each letter and number is substituted to create this unique language.

1. **Replace Letters with Numbers**:
   - 'A' becomes '4'
   - 'B' becomes '8'
   - 'E' becomes '3'
   - 'I' becomes '1'
   - 'L' becomes '1'
   - 'O' becomes '0'
   - 'S' becomes '5'
   - 'T' becomes '7'

2. **Transform Your Query**:
   - {1337-5p34k} = {1 3 3 7 - 5 p 3 4 k}

3. **Putting It All Together**:
   - Translate each letter in your query to its leetspeak equivalent: 
     - '1' for 'I'
     - '3' for 'E'
     - '3' for 'E'
     - '7' for 'T'
     - '5' for 'S'
     - 'p' remains 'p'
     - '3' for 'E'
     - '4' for 'A'
     - 'k' remains 'k'

4. **Final Translation**:
   - Your original query {1337-5p34k} in leetspeak is ""IEET SPEAK""

Congratulations! You've now mastered the art of leetspeak conversion. Feel free to impress your friends with your newfound knowledge and linguistic skills.
